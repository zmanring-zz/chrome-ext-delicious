# @Delicious

> When using Delicious.com and this extension, multiple tags could return as one tag. This is a [known](https://github.com/avos/delicious-api/issues/8) issue and Delicious is working on it. @Delicious extension has a work around by selecting "My tags have no spaces" option via [Options](/options.html) page. Sorry for the inconvenience. -Zach
